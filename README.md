## Percolation

This program uses the union find algorithm to test how long it takes for a system to percolate, i.e. 
connect the top to the bottom. While the underlying algorithm is extremely effcient, the visualizer is not. 
The highest recommended value for this visual representation is 100.

## Requirements

The visualizer for this project uses the Processing Framework, which needs to be included in the class path
